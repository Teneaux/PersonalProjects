using UnityEngine;
//Script by: Santino Williams
//Script functionalities should include:
//On start oscillate the cannon barrel -> Move Cannon along Z-Axis, clamped at 25, and -20
//Determine strength of the shot -> Determine a force variable from a set beginning and end range
//Fire the shot ->  Instantiate the Cannonball object ->  Add Force to the Cannonball object based on the previously output force variable
public class CannonController : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called once before the first execution of Update after the MonoBehaviour is created
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
